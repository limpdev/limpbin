🍆 fucking 238 fucking megabytes for this 74-line-mostly-white-space-wonder-shit ®️Pythonically Verified©️ spaghetti.

```bash
    Convert a markdown file to HTML using the markdown2 library and a template.

    Args:

        markdown_file (str): Path to the markdown file

        output_file (str, optional): Path to the output HTML file. If None,
                                     will use the same name as the markdown
                                      file but with .html extension.
```

> [!WARNING]
> DON'T LOSE THE FUCKING HTML FILE.

- Unlike pymo's gopher counterpart, I didn't embed the HTML. The difference between `go build` and `pyinstaller` on the matter of building executables is not something to be trifled with. This fresh dump took like 10 minutes to compile.

The worst part about this is that markdown2 is way more accurate than blackfridayV2, becuase fuck you that's why.
