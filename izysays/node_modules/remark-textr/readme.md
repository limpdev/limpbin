## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin to support [Textr][].

## When should I use this?

This project is useful if you want to automatically improve the text in your
markdown documents.
[Textr][] is a simple way to do that: no need to worry about ASTs.
On the other hand, ASTs are powerful, so some things are better done with
custom plugins: see [Create a plugin][unified-create-a-plugin].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-textr
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import remarkTextr from 'https://esm.sh/remark-textr@6'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkTextr from 'https://esm.sh/remark-textr@6?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file `example.md`:

````markdown
## spread operator...

```js
function(...args) { return args; }
```
````

…and a module `example.js`:

```js
/**
 * @typedef {import('remark-textr').TextrPlugin} TextrPlugin
 */

import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkTextr from 'remark-textr'
import {read} from 'to-vfile'

const file = await remark()
  .use(remarkTextr, {plugins: [ellipses]})
  .process(await read('example.md'))

console.log(String(file))

/**
 * Replace triple dots with ellipses.
 *
 * @type {TextrPlugin}
 */
function ellipses(input) {
  return input.replace(/\.{3}/gim, '…')
}
```

…then running `node example.js` yields:

````markdown
## spread operator…

```js
function(...args) { return args; }
```
````

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`remarkTextr`][api-remark-text].

### `unified().use(remarkTextr[, options])`

[Improve typography][typewriter-habits] with [Textr][].

###### Parameters

*   `options` ([`Options`][api-options], optional)
    — configuration

###### Returns

Transform ([`Transformer`][unified-transformer]).

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

###### Fields

*   `options` (`object`, optional)
    — configuration passed to `textr`;
    for example, you may want to set the ISO 639-1 [locale code][textr-locale]
    of the content, which is important for stuff like the correct primary and
    secondary quotes
*   `plugins` (`Array<TextrPlugin | string>`, optional)
    — textr plugins;
    if strings are passed in, those are loaded with `import`

### `TextrPlugin`

Textr plugin (TypeScript type).

Textr plugins are available on npm labelled with a [`textr`][textr-plugins]
keyword.
You can also create them yourself, as shown in the example above.

###### Parameters

*   `value` (`string`)
    — value to transform
*   `options` (`object`)
    — global configuration passed to textr

###### Returns

Changed text (`string`, optional).

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional types [`Options`][api-options] and
[`TextrPlugin`][api-textr-plugin].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `remark-textr@^6`,
compatible with Node.js 16.

This plugin works with `unified` version 6+ and `remark` version 7+.

## Security

Use of `remark-textr` does not involve **[rehype][]** (**[hast][]**) or user
content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][wiki-xss]
attacks.
[Textr][] operates on text nodes, which are always escaped by remark.
